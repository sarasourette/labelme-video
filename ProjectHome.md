# LabelMeVideo #
Computers currently have difficulty understanding what is happening in images and video. As
an extension of LabelMe, we introduce a new open annotation tool to collect a large database of objects in video by welcoming and collecting contributions from many people.

The LabelMe video project was developed as part of a computer vision research effort at MIT to build a large database of open and annotated videos. This code was developed by [Jenny Yuen](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jenny) and [Antonio Torralba](http://people.csail.mit.edu/torralba) and includes:

  * Flash client application responsible for annotating objects and events in videos hosted on a web server.
  * The necessary server-side scripts to manage annotation storage in an Apache web server.

For instructions on how to install and run a copy of LabelMeVideo in your own server, read the LabelMeVideoInstallationInstructions.



More information on the tool and project can be found in the LabelMeVideo [database page](http://labelme.csail.mit.edu/LabelMeVideo).
