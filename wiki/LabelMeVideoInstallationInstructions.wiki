Here you will find instructions to install and deploy LabelMeVideo in your own server. 

= System requirements = 

  # Run an Apache server.
  # Allow perl/CGI scripts to run.

= Installation instructions = 

  # Download the LabelMeVideo source code
  # Unzip the downloaded file and copy the {{{LabelMeVideo}}} folder to where you want to run your application. For example, in Mac OS X, an Apache web server serves the user pages located in  {{{   /Users/<username>/Sites}}}, where `<username`> is your user name.  Copy the {{{LabelMeVideo}}} folder here and you should be able to see a directory listing of the files in this folder.
  {{{
  http://localhost/~<username>/LabelMeVideo
  }}}  
  # Open {{{http://localhost/~<username>/LabelMeVideo/helloWorld.pl}}}  in your web browser. You should get a screen like this. Otherwise, this means that your web server is not properly configured to run {{{cgi}}} scripts.

  # Open on {{{http://localhost/~<username>/LabelMeVideo/VLM.html}}} in your web browser. This opens the annotation tool which should look like this.
   [http://labelme-video.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/vlm_debug_screenshot.png]
  # Set the correct permissions to the folders so the web server scripts can write and access the annotations in the folders. The web server code works by executing a cgi script that writes the annotations as xml files into the appropriate locations. Apache runs as a user in each platform/configuration differently (e.g. in Mac OS it might run as _nobody_ while in most Linux platforms as _www-data_). Change the permissions in the following directories such that such user has access to them. For example, in a standard Mac OS X configuration you would run: 
{{{
sudo chown -R nobody  TmpVLMAnnotations VLMAnnotations Logs
}}}
  In most Linux distributions Apache runs as _www-data_:
{{{
sudo chown -R www-data  TmpVLMAnnotations VLMAnnotations Logs 
}}}
  Finally, test that everything works by annotating an object in one of the videos, saving it, and *refreshing* the browser to make sure the annotations saved correctly.


= Annotating your own videos =

You can annotate your own videos by copying them to the *{{{LabelMeVideo/VLMVideos}}}* folder.

== Video requirements ==


  * flv formatted. When encoding videos to flv, try to set for as many keyframes as possible. This step is important as a higher density of keyframes means that the video player will be able to seek into a particular frame with a higher precision. It is likely that the videos you have are not in the required format. To convert them to flv, you can use the following [http://www.ffmpeg.org/ ffmpeg] command:

{{{
 ffmpeg -i  <srcName>  -g 1 -y -an  -f flv -b 6400  -qcomp 1   <destName> -y
}}}


  * Metadata-injected. There are many metadata injectors available for flv video. A recommended one is [http://yamdi.sourceforge.net/  yamdi]. This step is important as the video player relies on metadata information to create the video annotations

== Pointing the annotation tool to a different video ===
You can load a different video by editing the url to:
{{{
http://localhost/~jenny/LabelMeVideo/VLM.html#folder=<myFolder>&fileName=<myVideo.flv>
}}}
  

== Annotations ==

Your annotations will be saved as xml files and can be found in the *{{{LabelMeVideo/VLMAnnotations}}}* folder.
