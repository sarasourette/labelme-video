Here you will find instructions to install and deploy LabelMe video in your own server. 

= System requirements = 

  1. Run an Apache server.
  1. Allow perl/CGI scripts to run.

= Installation instructions = 

  1. Download the LabelMeVideo source code
  1. Unzip the downloaded file and copy the LabelMeVideo folder to where you want to run your application. For example, in Mac OS X, an Apache web server serves the user pages located in:
{{{ 
/Users/<username>/Sites
}}}

  Where `<username`> is your user name.  If you copy the LabelMeVideo folder here, you will be able to access the tool in a url that looks like this:
{{{
http://localhost/~<username>/LabelMeVideo
}}}

You should now be able to see a directory listing of the files in this folder.

  1. Open {{{http://localhost/~<username>/LabelMeVideo/helloWorld.pl}}}  in your web browser. You should get a screen like this. Otherwise, this means that your web server is not properly configured to run {{{cgi}}} scripts.

  1. Open on {{{http://localhost/~<username>/LabelMeVideo/VLM.html}}} in your web browser. This opens the annotation tool which should look like this.

= Annotating your own videos =

You can annotate your own videos by copying them to the {{{VLMVideos}}} folder.

== Video requirements ==


  * flv formatted. When encoding videos to flv, try to set for as many keyframes as possible. This step is important as a higher density of keyframes means that the video player will be able to seek into a particular frame with a higher precision. It is likely that the videos you have are not in the required format. To convert them to flv, you can use the following ffmpeg command:

{{{
 ffmpeg -i  `<srcName>`  -g 1 -y -an  -f flv -b 6400  -qcomp 1   `<destName>` -y
}}}


  * Metadata-injected. There are many metadata injectors available for flv video. A recommended one is [http://yamdi.sourceforge.net/  yamdi]. This step is important as the video player relies on metadata information to create the video annotations
